           If you guys are new to paintball and it's you're first step you make on the course, I suggest that you wear clothing the first time to get use to the paintballs hitting you. After a while by getting hit by the paintballs somewhere on your body you will start to get use to it. Also don't get the best gun, hooper and air tank if you're a beginner and new to the sport. If you comne to our shop today open 24/7 we will hook you up with you gun that you want...
